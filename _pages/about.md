I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at University of California - Santa Barbara. I am currently seeking research opportunities in Scientific Computing and Machine Learning, as well as to trying learn more about backend web technologies and frameworks through internships and projects.

Outside of my professional interests, I am looking to learn more about Mathematics, History, and Philosophy. In my free time, I enjoy Mixed Martial Arts, Boxing, and Basketball. Always up for a good pickup game!
